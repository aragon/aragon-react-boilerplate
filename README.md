React boilerplate for Aragon applications.

This boilerplate also includes a fully working example app, complete with a background worker and a front-end in React (with Aragon UI).

## Usage

```sh
aragon init foo.aragonpm.test react
```

## Running your app

### Using HTTP

Running your app using HTTP will allow for a faster development process of your app's front-end, as it can be hot-reloaded without the need to execute `aragon run` every time a change is made.

- First start your app's development server running `npm run start:app`, and keep that process running. By default it will rebuild the app and reload the server when changes to the source are made.

- After that, you can run `npm run start:aragon:http` which will compile your app's contracts, publish the app locally and create a DAO. You will need to stop it and run it again after making changes to your smart contracts.

Changes to the app's background script (`app/script.js`) cannot be hot-reloaded, after making changes to the script, you will need to either restart the development server (`npm run start:app`) or rebuild the script `npm run build:script`.

### Using IPFS

Running your app using IPFS will mimic the production environment that will be used for running your app. `npm run start:aragon:ipfs` will run your app using IPFS. Whenever a change is made to any file in your front-end, a new version of the app needs to be published, so the command needs to be restarted.

## What's in the box?

### npm Scripts

- **start** or **start:aragon:ipfs**: Runs your app inside a DAO served from IPFS
- **start:aragon:http**: Runs your app inside a DAO served with HTTP (hot reloading)

- **compile**: Compile the smart contracts
- **build**: Builds the front-end and background script
- **build:app**: Builds the front-end
